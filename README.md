buid a repository (owner)

invite team members as collaborator (repository owner)

we can't code on the same branch at the same time on the same file -> it may cause conflict 
that's why, we divided into different branches 
- repository owner create different branches 
- team member will create its own branch on its way 

command line - git branch BranchName (local branch), 
switch command - git checkout BranchName 

local branch -> online 
git push --set-upstream origin BranchName (local branch, no online, use this) 



------------------------------
git add .
git commit -m "implement about us"
git push 
------------------------------

main branch -> merge 

git checkout main 
git merge Ruby(branchName) 
------------------------------
